			 Hi my name is  Gloria, I’m from Brooklyn NY, I have an Associate degree in applied science.The Reason that I want to be apart of the Web Development Industry is because i’m obsessed with finding out what goes on behind the scenes of creating and web site from nothing.
			 I live and breathe technology, I want to be apart of an industry that is always changing and improving. The skills that I bring to web development would be that i’m self motivated, I love being creative,I have computer skills and i’m very determined to learn the skills that it takes to become a web developer. I’m interested in learning the ends and outs of creating a fully functioning website that the world will see. I want to see and be apart of the complete process that it takes to create a website. I know that I have the ability to be a leader and work under pressure.My short-term goal is to learn how to build a website and break into the Web Development industry. My ultimate long-term goal is to have a satisfying career in the Web development industry and grow with Technology.<br>
